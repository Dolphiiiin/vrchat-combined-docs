This page answers frequently asked questions about the Creator Economy.

If your question isn't listed here, please let us know by clicking the <FeedbackButton /> button.

## General Information

#### What's the Creator Economy? ####

The Creator Economy allows you to earn VRChat Credits by setting [listings](/economy/listings), [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) and [stores](/economy/store). You can spend earned Credits in VRChat, or [request a payout](/economy/payout) via PayPal.

#### How do I get started?

 [Apply to join the CE](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/creator-economy-application-seller) if you're not already an approved seller.
 
You need to [get started with Tilia](./getting-started) before you can create [listings](./listings), [subscriptions](./subscriptions), [products](./products), or [stores](./store).

***
## Payment Processing ##

#### What are VRChat Credits?
VRChat Credits<ThemedCreditIcon/> are VRChat's currency for the Creator Economy. They are similar to premium currencies found in other video games.
Users can purchase VRChat Credits and spend them on creators.
Creators can earn credits and pay them out in USD, if eligible.

#### What’s the conversion of VRChat Credits to USD?

When you request a [payout](/economy/payout), your earned VRChat credits are paid out at the following rate:

1<ThemedCreditIcon/> ≈ 0.005 US$

200<ThemedCreditIcon/> ≈ 1 US$

In other words, for each 1200<ThemedCreditIcon/> (≈10 US\$) users spend in your store, your [payout](/economy/payout) increases by approximately 5 US\$.

Please refer to the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy) and the [payout documentation](/economy/payout) to learn more.

#### What's the revenue split?

After paying out your earnings, you earn approximately 50% of what users spent in your store (excluding VAT).

Please refer to the [payout](/economy/payout) page to learn more

#### What's Tilia? ####
Tilia is VRChat's business partner for Creator Economy.
Tilia is a payment platform for accounts, wallets, payments, invoices, and payouts. As a VRChat seller, you'll be interacting with Tilia when [getting started](/economy/getting-started) and [requesting payouts](/economy/payout).

#### What payment methods are available? ####
VRChat credits are purchased through your platform's payment system, such as Steam or Meta.

Please note that VRChat Plus and VRChat Credits are not yet available on all platforms. Please send us [feedback](https://feedback.vrchat.com/) if there's a platform you'd like us to support!

#### What payout methods are available? ####
Tilia currently supports payouts to PayPal.
Additional payout methods may become available in the future. If you're a seller, tell us on [Canny](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy-sellers) what payout methods you would like to see!

#### How long does it take Tilia to process payouts?
Payout requests are usually processed within 1-2 business days. If your payout takes longer than 5 business days, please check your email inbox to see if it was rejected.

#### Why did my payout get rejected?
If your payout got rejected, it's usually for one of the following reasons:

- Your name on PayPal does not match your name on Tilia. Ensure that you entered your name correctly.
- PayPal does not support sending payouts to your country. Check your country in [PayPal's documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/standard/reference/country-feature/). 

When your payout gets rejected, Tilia usually sends you an email. Please check your inbox and spam folder for an email from Tilia.

#### Can users refund group subscriptions?
Yes. If users buy a group subscription, they choose how many months to buy in advance. If they purchase two or months, they can refund any remaining months, excluding the current month.
For example, if a user buys a 3 month group subscription, they can cancel their subscription and receive a refund for the remaining 2 months of credits. Transaction fees are not refunded.

***
## Products and Listings

#### How can worlds use the Creator Economy?
Worlds can use [Udon](/worlds/udon/) and [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) to detect purchases. Support for Udon products and the Creator Economy is [built into the Worlds SDK](/economy/sdk/).
#### What can world creators do with the Creator Economy SDK? ####
- Create Udon products on [VRChat.com](https://vrchat.com/home/) and link them to Udon products in your world.
- Unlock exclusive areas, items, or features.
- Open your store directly, making it easy for customers to support you.
- Create a list displaying the names of all your supporters.
- And more!

Visit the [Creator Economy SDK documentation](/economy/sdk/) to get started!

#### Can I use products from another creator? ####
No. You must be the content owner to use a product. For example, if you own a world, you can't use Udon products from another creator.

You **can** open another creator's store, group, or listing with the [SDK](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting).

#### Can I sell avatars in my world store?

Yes, you can add [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) to permanent listings. However, you can't add avatar products to temporary listings, instant listings, or subscriptions.

#### If I sell a permanent listing, what are the support requirements?  
  
If you wish to continue to be eligible to receive payouts from the Creator Economy, you must make reasonable efforts to update your content for security, technical and other reasons, including ensuring compatibility with the latest version of the Platform and all hardware on which the Platform is available. If you wish to opt out of ongoing participation in the Creator Economy, please contact us.

***
## Miscellaneous

#### Am I allowed to make changes to my listings and subscriptions?

Yes. You may change listings, subscriptions, and the products they contain. Depending on your content, users may expect different types of changes, additions, or removals. This helps you support your existing customers and improve your content.

However, don't "bait-and-switch" users by taking away their purchases unexpectedly. Don't deceive users.

Some product types, such as [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), cannot be removed from a listing after any user has purchased the listing.
#### Do users have to be part of my group to buy a subscription?

Yes. However, if your group is not set to "Free Join", you can allow paying users to join your group by enabling the [Enable Free Join for Subscribers](/economy/subscriptions#4-role-permissions) setting in your subscription role settings.

Users can leave your group after buying a subscription. They lose access to their subscription role, but keep all products until the subscription expires. 

#### Can I split my earnings with another creator? ####
There is currently no split pay functionality. The [payout](/economy/payout) process is only available to the seller.

#### Can a listing be free? ####
No, listings cannot be free. Read our [pricing guidelines](/economy/listings#31-pricing) to learn more

However, for [testing](/economy/sdk/testing), you can purchase your own listings for 0<ThemedCreditIcon/> in VRChat.

#### Where can I provide feedback? ####
VRChat uses Canny for our community feedback and bug reports. Feel free to post on the Creator Economy section of our [feedback page.](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy)

#### If a creator deletes a product, will that automatically update/delete any listings that contain that product? ####
You cannot delete products that have any owners or active subscribers. You will see an error informing them that the product has active purchases and that it cannot be deleted. Instead, you may wish to delete the listing that the product is contained in.

# Content Guidelines

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';
import ThemedCreditIcon from '/docs/economy/_credit-icon.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Creators who sell content through VRChat's Creator Economy must adhere to the following rules and guidelines.

Please note that the Creator Economy is a growing and evolving system. These rules are subject to change as VRChat continues to explore new implementations and use cases. 

All Creator Economy content must follow the rules below.

## General
1. You must follow VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
	1. This includes the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy), [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and [Creator Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines).
	2. You may only sell content that you fully own or have the legal right to distribute, including any third-party elements. Ensure you have the necessary licenses or permissions. (See section 8.4 of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal))
2. If your content is found to be in violation of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) or any of the Content Guidelines listed on this page, you must make reasonable efforts to address the violation within 10 days of being alerted via email of the issue.
	1. For example, if your avatar contains content activated by use of a toggle that is not permitted on the marketplace, you must make reasonable efforts to upload a new avatar build that removes this content within 10 days of being notified.
3. Clearly define what the user is purchasing.
	1. Listings, subscriptions, and products should have clear names and sufficiently detailed descriptions.
	2. Content should avoid engaging in [Dark Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) (or Deceptive Design Patterns) such as misdirection, bait-and-switch, and others.
	3. Content must avoid false advertising and not misrepresent the content or prices of listings and subscriptions. Names, tags, descriptions, acknowledgements, images, and previews used should not be misleading. Keep in mind that if your content looks very different in VRChat than in the images you've used to showcase it, buyers may be disappointed.
	4. Listings containing different types of products should make it clear where those products can be used. For example, if you are selling a bundle containing [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) *and* [Udon products](/economy/products/udon), ensure the buyer understands that while they can use the avatars anywhere, the Udon Products can only be used in specific world(s).
4. If feature parity exists, the Creator Economy should be used in addition to any off-platform monetization methods.
	1. For example, if perks or benefits for a VRChat world are sold through an off-platform subscription service, then those perks should also, when possible, be available for purchase in the Creator Economy.
	2. Don't price your external offering to drive VRChat users off-platform.
	3. If you cannot replicate the same external monetization offering inside VRChat (e.g. avatar source file downloads), these rules may not apply to you. Feel free to explore the Creator Economy's current offerings. If VRChat does not currently support your monetization method, try your best, and make a [feature request](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy).
5. Don't use VRChat's Creator Economy systems as a marketing tool for your external monetization offerings. For example:
	1. Don't prompt customers to refund their purchase and use a different payment method instead.
	2. Don’t use your listing description to advertise a cheaper price on other platforms.
	3. Don't encourage users to purchase your content on another platform so they can gain access to source files.
6. You cannot use VRChat Credits as a method of fundraising.
	1. Fundraiser payment methods must be hosted outside of the VRChat platform.
	2. It is allowed to ask for donations for external fundraisers that are not funded through the Creator Economy.
	3. You are permitted to ask for donations through your supporters, though donations towards fundraisers and charity organizations are often taxed differently between countries, and should be managed only with fiat currencies.
7. Costs should always be displayed in "VRChat Credits", the VRChat Credit icon<ThemedCreditIcon/>,
 or "\V".
	1. Many users are in different countries with different currencies. Use "VRChat Credits" to correctly convey the cost of your products to your buyers.

## Worlds
1. Worlds cannot promote lotteries, raffles, or other "games of chance" involving real currency.
	1. Any systems integrating with real-world currency in methods of gambling, casino-style events, or with real-world benefits are strictly forbidden.
2. You cannot give a user a strictly negative experience in your world without having made a purchase.
	1. For example, don't drop users into a hole if they haven't paid. All users should have a comfortable experience when entering your world.
3. Your [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings, [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings, and [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) may not be priced higher than 10,000<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
## Avatars
1. Your avatar must be optimized and not cause significant performance issues in VRChat.
	1. Your avatar should have a performance rank of "Excellent," "Good," "Medium," or "Poor." 
	2. "Very Poor" avatars are only accepted on a case-by-case basis.
2. Your avatar must have a high degree of visual and technical fidelity.
	1. Avatars with cross-platform support are highly recommended. If your avatar is available on multiple platforms (e.g. PC, Android and/or iOS), its appearance should be similar on all platforms.
	2. If your avatar uses [expression menus](/avatars/expression-menu-and-controls/) or [components](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/), avoid technical issues or bugs.
3. Your avatar should not use colliders or [stations](/worlds/components/vrc_station/) to fly, teleport, or move quicker than other VRChat avatars.
	1. For example: You may use GoGo Loco, but not GoGo Flight.
4.  If your listing contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), its price must be least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/> per different avatar product in the listing, excluding variants of the same avatar. For example:
	1. If your listing contains two different avatars, it must cost at least 2,400<ThemedCreditIcon/> (1,200 <ThemedCreditIcon/> × 2).
	2. If your listing contains two variants of the same avatar, i.e. different colors or outfits, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
	3. If your listing contains a single avatar, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
5. Your avatar must follow the avatar content guidelines below.
	1. If your listing contains avatar products and Udon products, ensure that the Udon product is also consistent with the content guidelines below.

:::info

VRChat may reject some avatars despite fulfilling all the criteria above. VRChat currently only accepts a limited number of avatars. High-quality avatars are more likely to be accepted.
 
This restriction will become less strict in the future. Please visit our avatar seller Discord community for additional information.  

:::


### Avatar content guidelines

The guidelines below clarify what type of content is suitable for the avatar marketplace. These content guidelines apply to all configuration and viewing options for an avatar. Content that violates these guidelines in an alternate state or viewing mode (e.g. through a toggle, hidden in a texture, or otherwise "locked" to be inaccessible to the user) is not permitted.
 
#### Properties

1. Your avatar's name, description, tags, acknowledgements, images, and previews for marketplace avatars must adhere to VRChat's [public content guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines) for avatars.  
2. English must be the primary language of all words or characters in your avatar's properties, textures, or expressions menus.  
    - You're permitted to add additional non-English translations (with English equivalents).  
    - For example: The text in your expressions menu must be in English, but you may use icons to provide a Japanese translation.

#### Clothing & Appearance

Your avatar must have private areas appropriately covered or presented in a non-sexualized manner.

The marketplace allows creativity and stylization, but avatars should avoid conveying overt sexuality or nudity. For example, private areas with patterned textures may convey a sense of being covered, while flat shading resembling skin may imply nudity.

# Content Guidelines

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';
import ThemedCreditIcon from '/docs/economy/_credit-icon.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Creators who sell content through VRChat's Creator Economy must adhere to the following rules and guidelines.

Please note that the Creator Economy is a growing and evolving system. These rules are subject to change as VRChat continues to explore new implementations and use cases. 

All Creator Economy content must follow the rules below.

## General
1. You must follow VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).
	1. This includes the [Creator Economy Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy), [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and [Creator Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines).
	2. You may only sell content that you fully own or have the legal right to distribute, including any third-party elements. Ensure you have the necessary licenses or permissions. (See section 8.4 of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal))
2. If your content is found to be in violation of VRChat's [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) or any of the Content Guidelines listed on this page, you must make reasonable efforts to address the violation within 10 days of being alerted via email of the issue.
	1. For example, if your avatar contains content activated by use of a toggle that is not permitted on the marketplace, you must make reasonable efforts to upload a new avatar build that removes this content within 10 days of being notified.
3. Clearly define what the user is purchasing.
	1. Listings, subscriptions, and products should have clear names and sufficiently detailed descriptions.
	2. Content should avoid engaging in [Dark Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) (or Deceptive Design Patterns) such as misdirection, bait-and-switch, and others.
	3. Content must avoid false advertising and not misrepresent the content or prices of listings and subscriptions. Names, tags, descriptions, acknowledgements, images, and previews used should not be misleading. Keep in mind that if your content looks very different in VRChat than in the images you've used to showcase it, buyers may be disappointed.
	4. Listings containing different types of products should make it clear where those products can be used. For example, if you are selling a bundle containing [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) *and* [Udon products](/economy/products/udon), ensure the buyer understands that while they can use the avatars anywhere, the Udon Products can only be used in specific world(s).
4. If feature parity exists, the Creator Economy should be used in addition to any off-platform monetization methods.
	1. For example, if perks or benefits for a VRChat world are sold through an off-platform subscription service, then those perks should also, when possible, be available for purchase in the Creator Economy.
	2. Don't price your external offering to drive VRChat users off-platform.
	3. If you cannot replicate the same external monetization offering inside VRChat (e.g. avatar source file downloads), these rules may not apply to you. Feel free to explore the Creator Economy's current offerings. If VRChat does not currently support your monetization method, try your best, and make a [feature request](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy).
5. Don't use VRChat's Creator Economy systems as a marketing tool for your external monetization offerings. For example:
	1. Don't prompt customers to refund their purchase and use a different payment method instead.
	2. Don’t use your listing description to advertise a cheaper price on other platforms.
	3. Don't encourage users to purchase your content on another platform so they can gain access to source files.
6. You cannot use VRChat Credits as a method of fundraising.
	1. Fundraiser payment methods must be hosted outside of the VRChat platform.
	2. It is allowed to ask for donations for external fundraisers that are not funded through the Creator Economy.
	3. You are permitted to ask for donations through your supporters, though donations towards fundraisers and charity organizations are often taxed differently between countries, and should be managed only with fiat currencies.
7. Costs should always be displayed in "VRChat Credits", the VRChat Credit icon<ThemedCreditIcon/>,
 or "\V".
	1. Many users are in different countries with different currencies. Use "VRChat Credits" to correctly convey the cost of your products to your buyers.

## Worlds
1. Worlds cannot promote lotteries, raffles, or other "games of chance" involving real currency.
	1. Any systems integrating with real-world currency in methods of gambling, casino-style events, or with real-world benefits are strictly forbidden.
2. You cannot give a user a strictly negative experience in your world without having made a purchase.
	1. For example, don't drop users into a hole if they haven't paid. All users should have a comfortable experience when entering your world.
3. Your [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings, [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings, and [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) may not be priced higher than 10,000<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
## Avatars
1. Your avatar must be optimized and not cause significant performance issues in VRChat.
	1. Your avatar should have a performance rank of "Excellent," "Good," "Medium," or "Poor." 
	2. "Very Poor" avatars are only accepted on a case-by-case basis.
2. Your avatar must have a high degree of visual and technical fidelity.
	1. Avatars with cross-platform support are highly recommended. If your avatar is available on multiple platforms (e.g. PC, Android and/or iOS), its appearance should be similar on all platforms.
	2. If your avatar uses [expression menus](/avatars/expression-menu-and-controls/) or [components](/avatars/avatar-dynamics/), avoid technical issues or bugs.
3. In general, your avatar's updates should be limited to bug fixes, performance improvements, and new/improved features.
	1.  If you want to visibly and materially change a base avatar that has already been purchased, please contact us to discuss it. We may adjust this policy in the future.
4. Your avatar should not use colliders or [stations](/worlds/components/vrc_station/) to fly, teleport, or move quicker than other VRChat avatars.
	1. For example: You may use GoGo Loco, but not GoGo Flight.
5.  If your listing contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), its price must be at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/> per different avatar product in the listing, excluding variants of the same avatar. For example:
	1. If your listing contains two different avatars, it must cost at least 2,400<ThemedCreditIcon/> (1,200 <ThemedCreditIcon/> × 2).
	2. If your listing contains two variants of the same avatar, i.e. different colors or outfits, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
	3. If your listing contains a single avatar, it must cost at least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
5. Your avatar must follow the avatar content guidelines, available to authorized avatar sellers.


## Enforcement
Breaches of the guidelines above may result in the following actions being taken against your account:

- Your content or your store may be removed temporarily or permanently.
- Your permission to sell content may be revoked temporarily or permanently.
- Your user account may be banned temporarily or permanently.

# Listings

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';
import ThemedCreditIcon from '/docs/economy/_credit-icon.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Listings allow you to monetize your VRChat content by selling rewards, such as unlocking avatars or world features.

Users can buy listings, which contain [products](/economy/products/). Each listing can contain 1-15 products. Users keep the products until the listing expires, depending on its [duration type](#2-duration-type). For example, [permanent](#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings never expire, and [instant](#instant) listings expire immediately.

You can choose your listing's [visibility](#visibility). Listings can appear in your [store](/economy/store), or you can use Udon in your world to [open a listing](#udon-store-prefabs-in-your-world) directly, even if your store is not published.

Listings are similar to [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions).

## Create a listing

Create your first listing by following the steps below:

---

import Columns from '@site/src/components/Columns';
import Column from '@site/src/components/Column';

<Columns> 
<Column className='text--left'>

### 1. Create new listing

Open the [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings) section of your [Storefront](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/) on [VRChat.com](https://vrchat.com/home/) to create a listing.

Click "Create Listing" to create your first listing.

:::info

After creating your first listing, return to this screen to edit, publish, unpublish, or delete your listings.

</Column>
</Columns>

---

<Columns> 
<Column className='text--left'>

### 2. Duration Type

Choose one of the three duration type for your listing:

- Instant
- Temporary
- Permanent

You cannot change the type after creating your listing.

The differences between duration types are explained below.

</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>

![Choose listing duration on VRChat.com](/img/economy/listings/listing-choose-duration.png)

</Column>
</Columns>

<Columns> 
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ♾️Permanent
The duration of permanent listings is **unlimited**. Buyers gain lifetime access to the listing.

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)
- [Avatar products](/economy/products/avatar)

For example, you could sell permanent access to avatars, world features, or world cosmetics. 

</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ⌛Temporary
The duration of temporary listings is **five minutes to three months**. Buyers own the listing until the duration expires, similar to [group subscriptions](./subscriptions).

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)

For example, you could sell temporary benefits for your VRChat world, such as boosts, cosmetics, features, or trials.

You choose the duration of a temporary listing by editing its [details](#3-details). Buyers can't purchase the listing again until its duration expires.

</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>
#### ⚡Instant

Instant listings **do not have a duration**. Instead, you give buyers an immediate reward with Udon. Buyers can purchase the listing as many times as they want.

You can add the following products:
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)

For example, you could sell spawnable items, pickups, animations, or virtual persistent currencies for your world.

Only users who are currently in your world can buy instant listings. Otherwise, the purchase screen asks them to visit your world first.

</Column>
</Columns>

Click "Next" after choosing a duration type.

---

<Columns>
<Column  className='text--left'>

### 3. Details

:::

</Column>
<Column className='text--right'>

![Create listing screen on VRChat.com](/img/economy/listings/listing-edit-details.png)

</Column>

</Columns>

#### 3.1 Pricing

You may choose a price of 100-100,000<ThemedCreditIcon/> for most listing types.[^1] You can change the price later - users who currently own your listing are be affected.

However, non-[permanent](/economy/listings#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings and [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) have the following limitations:

- Your [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings, [temporary](/economy/listings#temporary) listings, and [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) may not be priced higher than 10,000<ThemedCreditIcon/>.
- If your listing contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), its price must be least 1,200<ThemedCreditIcon/> per different avatar product in the listing, excluding variants of the same avatar. For example:

:::

## Edit your listing

You can edit the details of your listings on the [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings/) page.

### Details

You can edit most details of your listing at any time, even after publishing it:
- ✅You can edit listing's **name, description, thumbnail,** and other general properties.
- ✅You can edit the **product name, description, thumbnail**, and other properties of products in your listing.
	- If you reupload an [avatar product](/economy/products/avatar), VRChat must review it first.
- ✅You can edit your listing's **price**.
    - If your listing is a subscription, existing owners are unaffected by the price change.
- ✅You can **add products** to your listing.
	- New and existing owners gain access to the products you added.
- ✅You can **remove [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) and [subscription role products](/economy/products/paid-role)** from your listing.
    - This is helpful if you want to reorganize your store or to give your supporters additional rewards.
	- Careful when removing these products - don't accidently remove benefits that your customers expect to own.
- ✅You can **change the duration** of [temporary](#temporary) listings.

Some aspects of your listing cannot be changed:
- ❌You cannot **change the [duration type](#2-duration-type)** of listings after creating them.
- ❌You cannot **remove [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar)** that any user currently owns.



### Delete

Click "Delete" on [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings/) to delete a listing. You only delete listings that don't have any owners.

- [Instant](#instant) listings can always be deleted.
- [Temporary](#temporary) listings can be deleted after you [unpublish](#4-visibility) them and wait for all current owners to expire.
- [Permanent](#%EF%B8%8Fpermanent) listings **cannot be deleted** after any user has purchased them.

### Visibility

The visibility of a listing depends on its status. Open [My Listings](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/listings/page/1) to change the status of your listings:

- "Published" listings can be purchased by users.
- "Draft" listings cannot be purchased by users. If users already purchased the listing, they keep it.

If your listing contains any [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), it's automatically published on VRChat's avatar marketplace. In addition, you may add it to a [world store](/economy/store).

If your listing does not contain any avatar products, users can only find it if you add it to your [world store](/economy/store) or if you have a store prefab in your world that uses Udon to open listings. (Use both to make your listings easier to find.)

:::tip
Use a combination of [stores](/economy/store) and Udon [store prefabs](/economy/sdk/examples/) to make your world listings easier for users to find.
:::

#### World stores

- Users see your world [store](/economy/store) when looking at your world in VRChat's menu.
- World stores are easy to create and manage from the [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores)
- The world store is visible when users look at your world details in VRChat's menu.
- Users don't have to be in your world to use your world store.

#### Avatar marketplace

- If your published listing contains any [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar), users automatically see your listing on the avatar marketplace. 

#### Udon store prefabs in your world

- You can use [Udon](/worlds/udon/) to create "Buy" buttons or custom stores inside your world.
- The [Open Listing](/economy/sdk/examples/open-listing) prefab allows you to easily add a "Buy" button that users can press when visiting your world.
- You can also create "hidden" listings that users can't find in your world store or elsewhere.
- If you're experienced with Udon, write your Udon scripts with the [Store.OpenListing](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting) method.

### Quantity Purchases

You can allow users to buy [instant](#instant) listings in large quantities. Go to the listing details and select "Enable Quantity Purchases". When users buy the listing, they can choose to buy it up to 99 times at once.

You should use the Udon method (OnPurchaseConfirmedMultiple)[/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#onpurchaseconfirmed] to detect the quantity of the purchase and give users an appropriate reward.


## Refunds

Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis by VRChat. You cannot directly issue refunds to your buyers. If you need help issuing refunds to buyers of your listings, please contact VRChat.

[^1]: VRChat may change the Creator Economy's minimum and maximum listing price in the future. We will inform you in advance before we implement a new minimum or maximum.

- 30%:[^1] to the platform (Steam/Meta),
- 50%:[^1] to creators,
- 20%:[^1] to VRChat and its payment processor.

## Fees

Fees are collected in the following three steps:

# Subscriptions

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';
import ThemedCreditIcon from '/docs/economy/_credit-icon.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Subscriptions are the easiest way to monetize your VRChat group. Users can visit your group store to buy a subscription and unlock world or group benefits.

Subscriptions can contain the following product types:
- [Subscription role products](/economy/products/paid-role)
- [Udon products](/economy/products/udon)

You can choose your subscription's [visibility](#visibility). Subscriptions can appear in your group store, or you can use Udon to [open a published subscription's purchase screen](/economy/sdk/examples/open-listing) directly, even if your store is unpublished.

Subscriptions are similar to [listings](/economy/listings).

## Subscriptions, roles, and products

Each subscriptions consists of a subscription, a subscription role product, and a subscription role. Here's how they're related:

<Columns> 
<Column className='text--left'>

### Subscription

Users buy subscription in your group [store](/economy/store). Subscribers gain access to the subscription's [products](/economy/products/). They lose access when their subscription ends.

Each subscriptions contains exactly one [subscription role product](#subscription-role-product). You can also add multiple [Udon products](/economy/products/udon).



</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>

### Subscription role product

Users who own this [product](/economy/products/) gain access to a [subscription role](#subscription-role) in your group.

When you create a subscription, you automatically create a role product. You cannot create subscription role products manually.


</Column>
<Column className='text--left'>

### Subscription role

Users with this [group role](https://wiki.vrchat.com/wiki/Groups#Group_roles_and_permissions) can gain special permissions in your group or group instances. You can use it as a reward for your subscribers.

To learn more, read the [subscription role documentation](/economy/products/paid-role).

</Column>
</Columns>

## Create a subscription

Follow the steps below to create your first subscription. You'll create a subscription, a subscription role product, and a subscription role.

import Columns from '@site/src/components/Columns';

### 1. Create new subscription

Create a new subscription on any of the following sections of the VRChat website: 

- [My Subscriptions](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/subscriptions)
	- Click "Create Subscription."
- [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores/)
	- Select a group.

### 2. Group

Choose a group for your subscription. If the group has no [group store](/economy/store/group-store), the website automatically creates a group store for you.

Each subscription is always connected to a single group. You cannot move the subscription to a different group later.

If you already chose a group in step 1, this step is skipped.

### 4. Role permissions

Users who buy your subscription also receive a group role. Choose the permissions of the group role. You can allow subscribers to view all members, enter group instances, gain instance queue priority, and more.

:::tip

Turn on "Enable Free Join for Subscribers" to allow subscribers to join your group directly, even if the original group settings are set to "Request to Join" or "Invite-Only". This makes it easier for users to subscribe without needing prior group access.

:::

You can change the permissions later in your [group settings](https://vrchat.com/home/groups). Read the [subscription role documentation](/economy/products/paid-role) to learn more.

Click "Next" to create the subscription, product, and role.

## Visibility

The visibility of a subscription depends on its status. Open [My Subscriptions](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/subscriptions) to change the status of your subscriptions:

- "Published" subscriptions can be purchased by users.
- "Draft" subscriptions cannot be purchased by users. If users already purchased the subscription, they keep it.

After publishing a subscriptions, users can only see it if you added it to a group [store](/economy/store) or if you have a store inside your world. 

:::tip
To maximize your sales, you should use world [stores](/economy/store) **and** add Udon stores to your world!

## Details about renewal, payout, and cancellation

When you use subscriptions to monetize your VRChat group, remember the following details:

- Subscriptions do not automatically renew when their duration expires.
	- Users see a notification when their subscription is about to expire.
- Users can extend their subscription before their current subscription ends.
	- For example: If a user's subscription expires in 7 days, and they buy a 12-month subscription, their subscription is extended to 12 months and 7 days
- When a user subscribes, you receive VRChat Credits for the first month immediately. If they subscribe for more than one month, you receive the remaining credits every month.
	- For example: If a user subscribes for 12 months, you immediately receive the VRChat Credits for the first month. Next month, you will receive the VRChat Credits for the second month, and so on.
- You do not receive VRChat Credits for remaining months when a user cancels their subscription.
	- For example: If a user subscribes for 12 months and immediately cancels, you only receive VRChat Credits for the first month.
- The subscription price includes a ~15.3% transaction fee.
	- See [CE Program Rules](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal/economy) and [Payout](/economy/payout).

[^1]: VRChat may change the Creator Economy's minimum and maximum subscription price in the future. We will inform you in advance before we implement a new minimum or maximum.

# Welcome to the Creator Economy

import SellerNotificationAVM from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification-avm.mdx';

The Creator Economy allows you to sell your content directly in VRChat, earn VRChat Credits, and pay out real money doing what you love. Whether you're an avatar creator, world builder, group leader, or all three, the Creator Economy gives you the tools to monetize your creations, engage your community, and grow your store.

</iframe>

This page provides a high-level overview of what the Creator Economy is, what you can sell, how it works, and how to get started.

## What is the Creator Economy?

The Creator Economy is a system built into VRChat that lets you do the following:

- **Sell [products](/economy/products/)** like like [world features](/economy/products/udon), [avatar access](/economy/products/avatar), or [group roles](/economy/products/paid-role).
- **Create [stores](/economy/store/)** so users can easily find and buy your content.
- **Earn VRChat Credits**, which can be paid out into real money.

You can sell content through three main systems:
- **[Listings](/economy/listings/)** - One-time purchases (permanent, temporary, or instant).
- **[Subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions)** - Ongoing monthly benefits sold through group stores.
- **[Stores](/economy/store/)** - The places users go to buy your content, like the avatar marketplace, your group page, your world page, or Udon UIs inside your world.

## What can you sell?

There are three product types you can create and sell:

### 🌍 Udon Products

Sell [Udon products](/economy/products/udon) that unlock features inside your worlds: Cosmetics, effects, items, access to special areas, supporter boards, and more. These are great for world creators and game worlds.

### 👥 Subscription Role Products

Sell [roles](/economy/products/paid-role) for your VRChat group. Roles grant access to groups, group instances, announcements, queues, or exclusive events.

### 🧍Avatar Products

:::info

Only approved avatar sellers can create and publish avatar products on the marketplace.

:::

Sell [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) that give users access to your avatars. You can sell avatars in permanent listings, and they appear in the [avatar marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace).

## How do sales work?

Users don't directly buy [products](/economy/products/). Instead, they buy [listings](/economy/listings) in [stores](/economy/store/).

### 🛍 Listings & Subscriptions

[Listings](/economy/listings) are flexible packages that bundle one or more products. You can create three types of listings:

- **Permanent**: The user keeps the products forever.    
- **Temporary**: The products expire after a set time (like 5 minutes or 3 months).
- **Instant**: The effect happens once and immediately (e.g., spawn a pickup).

[Subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) are similar to listings:

- **Subscriptions**: Ongoing monthly access, only sold in group stores.

### 🏪 Stores

[Stores](/economy/store/) are where users buy your listings or subscriptions. There are three kinds of stores:

- **[Avatar Marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace)** - Where all published avatar listings live.
- **[World Stores](/economy/store/world-store)** -  Attached to your world page. Contains listings.
- **[Group Stores](/economy/store/group-store)** - Attached to your VRChat group page. Contains subscriptions.

To maximize reach, you can add the same listing in multiple stores. In addition, you add stores to your world or [open listings directly with Udon](/economy/sdk/getting-started).

The chart below shows you how different types of stores, listings, and products are connected:

![This chart shows which types of listings can be added to listings and subscriptions, and which store types support listings and subscriptions.](/img/economy/overview.png)

## Earning Money

Users buy your content with **VRChat Credits**. You can:
- Spend credits in other VRChat stores.
- Or, **request a [payout](/economy/payout)** in USD to your PayPal account.

### 💵 Revenue Split

- **~50%** goes to you, the creator.
- **~30%** goes to the platform users bought credits from (e.g., Steam or Meta).
- **~20%** goes to VRChat and its payment partner, Tilia (transaction and platform fees).


:::note
- Credit purchase price:	120 Credits	≈ 1 USD
- Credit payout rate:		200 Credits	≈ 1 USD  
- Minimum to cash out:	30,000 Credits ≈ 150 USD
:::

Learn more about payouts on the [payout](/economy/payout) page.

### Content Guidelines and Requirements

All content must follow VRChat’s terms. Please review the rules on the [Content Guidelines page](https://creators.vrchat.com/economy/guidelines).

## How do you join?

If you’re not already part of the Creator Economy:

2. Wait for your application to be reviewed. Keep an eye on your inbox for an invitation or rejection email.
3. If you're accepted, follow the instructions in the email!
