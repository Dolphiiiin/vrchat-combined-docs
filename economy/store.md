# Avatar Marketplace

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification-avm.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

The avatar marketplace contains [avatar products](/economy/products/avatar) available for purchase in VRChat. It's the most convenient way to discover, buy, and sell VRChat avatars.

## Browse the Marketplace

The avatar marketplace is located in the "Avatars" section of the VRChat menu. Users can browse the marketplace, search for published avatars, and see their [details](/economy/products/avatar#avatar-details). Selecting any avatar product takes the user to its details page.

## Publish an Avatar on the Marketplace

Follow the steps below to publish your avatar on the marketplace:

1. Upload an [avatar](/avatars/creating-your-first-avatar).
2. Create an [avatar product](/economy/products/avatar).
3. Wait for VRChat to review and accept your avatar product.
4. Create a [listing](/economy/listings).
5. Add your avatar product to your listing.
6. Publish your listing.
7. (Optional) Add your listing to a [world store](/economy/store/world-store).

Users can now buy your avatar in VRChat and discover it on the marketplace.

## Become an avatar seller

Only authorized avatar sellers create and publish avatar products on the marketplace. To become an authorized avatar seller, please [submit an application](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MC5X89R). We will slowly authorize more avatar sellers over time.

 If you are already a seller in the Creator Economy and wish to gain access to the avatar marketplace, please apply.

# Group Stores

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Group stores allow you to easily sell [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) for your group. After you publish a group store, users can use your group's "Store" tab to discover and buy subscriptions.

If you have a VRChat world, you can add a button that opens your store. Use the [Open Group Page prefab](/economy/sdk/examples/open-group-page) or [`Store.OpenGroupStorePage`](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopengroupstorepage).

## Create a Group Store

The easiest way to create a group store is to create a [subscription](/economy/subscriptions). If your group does not have a store, creating a subscription also creates a group store.

Alternatively, you can create a group store from the [Store Manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores) by following the steps below:

1. Open the [store manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores) on the VRChat website.
2. Click the "Set up new store" button.
3. Select "Group Store."
4. Select one of your groups.
5. Click "Create" to create your group store.
	  - After creating your group store, users won't see it until you publish subscriptions and publish the store.
6. Create [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) and add them to your group.
	- You can use the [store manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores) to rearrange the order in which users see subscriptions in your store. 
7. Publish the subscriptions.
8. Publish your group store in the [store manager](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/stores).

:::info

If you have a world, use [Udon](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation) to sell your published listings and subscriptions. For example, the [Open Listing prefab](/economy/sdk/examples/open-listing) makes it easier for users to buy subscriptions, increasing your sales.

If you don't want to publish a world store at all, you can use Udon to sell subscriptions instead!

:::

## Viewing your Group Store

After you publish your group store, users can find it by opening the group in VRChat (or the VRChat website) and pressing the "Store" button. They can browse your published subscriptions and buy them.

You can share your group by copying its URL from the VRChat website or by sharing its group ID (e.g., `GROUP.1234`). Users can enter the ID in the Groups tab in VRChat, allowing them to view or join your group.

## Limitations

- Group stores cannot contain [listings](/economy/listings).
- You cannot transfer your group if it has any subscribers.

# World Stores

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

	- You can use Udon to open listings directly, i.e. with [Store.OpenListing](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storeopenlisting).
	- You can't sell [instant](/economy/listings#instant) listings without adding them to your world store. In addition, only users who are currently visiting your world can buy instant listings.
- You cannot add [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) to your world stores.
	- Use group stores instead.
