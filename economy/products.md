# Avatar Product


import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification-avm.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

This page explains how to configure your [avatar's properties](#create-an-avatar) and create an [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product).

Avatar products allow you to give users avatars when they buy a [listing](/economy/listings) from you. Each avatar product is associated with one of your uploaded avatars.


After you publish your avatar product, users can discover it in several places:
- The [avatar marketplace](/economy/store/avatar-marketplace) contains all avatar products published in any of your listings.
- Your [world store](/economy/store/world-store) (if you have one) can sell permanent listings containing avatar products.
- Users can access details page of avatar products from various other places in VRChat's menu. For example, users can select other users and press the "Open Avatar Details" button.

## Create an Avatar

Before you can create an avatar product, you must upload an [avatar](/avatars/) in Unity and configure its [details](#avatar-details) on the VRChat website.

:::info

If this is your first time creating an avatar, learn how to [create your first avatar](/avatars/creating-your-first-avatar).

:::

After uploading your avatar, you can find it on the VRChat website in [My Avatars](https://vrchat.com/home/avatars) and configure its [details](#avatar-details).

### Avatar Details

Avatar details give users additional information about your avatar. They help users find and buy your [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product). 

Open [my Avatars](https://vrchat.com/home/avatars) and click the "‚úèÔ∏è" icon to edit your avatar's details. Most details are optional and you can change them at any time.

:::info
If you list multiple variants of the same avatar as separate products, please give them thoughtful and descriptive names.
:::

| Detail | Type | Limitations |
| - | - | - |
| Name | Text |Up to 64 characters |
| Description | Text | Up to 256 characters |
| Thumbnail | Image | Between 64x64 and 2048x2048 px, 1:1 aspect ratio, up to 10 MB |
| Gallery | Image | Up to 6 images, up to 1MB each, exactly 1920x1080 recommended |
| Primary Style | Single-select | Up to 1 [avatar style](#avatar-styles) |
| Secondary Style | Single-select | Up to 1 [avatar style](#avatar-styles) |
| Tags | Text | Up to 10 tags, up to 64 characters each |
| Acknowledgements | Text | Up to 300 characters |
| Content warnings | Multi-select | Up to 5 content warnings |

When users view your avatar product, they can also see automatically generated details, such as its [performance rank](/avatars/avatar-performance-ranking-system), [platforms](/platforms/), and file size. They also see a list of all listings that contain the avatar product, making it easy to buy the avatar immediately.

After creating an avatar and editing its details, you can create an [avatar product](#create-an-avatar-product).

### Avatar Styles

You can choose a primary style and a secondary style in your [avatar details](#avatar-details). Styles are optional, but they help buyers find the types of avatars they are interested in.

You can choose between the following styles:

- **Animal**: Animal-inspired avatars
- **Anime**: Avatars inspired by Japanese stylistic conventions
- **Cartoon**: Avatars with a stylized or toon-shaded aesthetic
- **Fantasy**: Avatars inspired by dragons, fairies, elves, and other mythical beings
- **Fashion**: Stylishly dressed avatars
- **Furry**: Anthropomorphic animal-inspired avatars and/or avatars associated with furry fandoms
- **Human**: Avatars that resemble people
- **Objects**: Inanimate avatars (appliances, food, shapes, vehicles, etc.)
- **Pop Culture**: Avatars inspired by content that appeals to a mass audience
- **Realistic**: Avatars rendered in a style that is representative of the natural world
- **Sci-Fi**: Futuristic, robotic, cybernetic or alien avatars

You cannot choose the same primary and secondary style. For example, you can't choose "Anime" and "Anime" twice.

If you don't want to set either a primary or secondary style, choose "Not Specified" instead.

## Update an Avatar Product

If you want to improve or update your avatar, you can edit it in Unity and upload a new version (using the same avatar ID).

When you upload a new version an avatar product, you must wait 1-2 business days for VRChat's approval. Afterwards, the update is automatically published.

:::warning

After you have sold your avatar to one or more users, limit your updates to the following changes:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- New or improved features

:::

While waiting for approval, users can continue buying and using the previously approved version of your avatar. When VRChat approves the new version, all owners see the new version instead.

While waiting for approval, you can also continue uploading newer versions of your avatar. If you upload multiple versions in a short period of time, VRChat only reviews the latest version, ignoring older versions.

## Avatar content guidelines

Your avatar must meet VRChat's marketplace standards and Terms and Conditions. Our reviewers verify performance, compatibility, and eligibility.

:::warning

The avatar content guidelines may change rapidly while the avatar marketplace is still in development.

# Subscription Role Product

All [subscriptions](/economy/subscriptions) contain a subscription role product. This product automatically makes them a member of your group and gives them a subscription role. You can give users with subscription roles special permissions, such as access to announcements, group instances, or priority queues.  

Subscription roles are always connected to a single [subscription](/economy/subscriptions). Unlike [Udon products](/economy/products/udon), you cannot manually add or remove subscription role products from a subscription.

## Create a subscription role product

You can create a subscription role product by creating a subscription or creating a paid role.

### Create a subscription

[Create a subscription](/economy/subscriptions) on the [My Subscriptions](https://vrchat.com/home/marketplace/storefront/subscriptions/page/1) page. This is the easiest way to create a subscription role product.


### Create manually

You can create a subscription role product manually, which also creates a subscription for you. This process is more complex than creating a subscription first.

:::warning Known issue

The text and screenshots in this section use the outdated term "paid role" instead of "subscription role product."

:::

1. Navigate to [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home)
2. Go to your **Groups** tab in the left-hand sidebar.
3. After choosing a Group you own, go to **Settings** > **Roles**.
4. Choose **Create Paid Role**.
    1. Note: You will be prompted to agree to the Tilia Terms of Service before you can set up paid roles. [Read on setting up with Tilia here.](/economy/getting-started)

[IMAGE: Create paid role]

:::warning known issue

You cannot create more than five (paid) roles with the "View all members" permission. See [Canny](https://feedback.vrchat.com/creator-economy-sellers/p/cannot-create-more-than-five-paid-roles-with-view-all-members-permission).

:::

5. Enter a name and description for your role.
6. You can set any role-specific permissions here.

[IMAGE: Edit paid role]

7. Click the Save button. You‚Äôve made your first paid role!

Subscriptions are tied directly to your Paid Roles, but have plenty of other customization options! You can find out how to edit your subscription on the [Your Store](/economy/store) tab.


***
## Restrictions

When creating a subscription role, please keep the following restrictions in mind: 

* You can only create subscription roles for Groups you own.
* Subscription roles can't give users access to moderation permissions in your Group.
* The role cannot violate our [CE Content Guidelines](/economy/guidelines), [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines) or [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal).

# Udon Product

import SellerNotification from '/docs/economy/_sellers-notification.mdx';

<SellerNotification/>

Your worlds can detect Udon products and reward players who own one of your listings. You can unlock new areas, customize your world, display a "Thank you" message, or something else.

Before you can use Udon products in your world, you need to create them on the VRChat website by following these steps:

## Creating Udon products

1. Navigate to [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home)
2. Go to the **Marketplace** tab in the left-hand sidebar, then open **Storefront**.
3. Scroll down and select **My Products**.

[IMAGE: How to create Udon products on VRChat.com..]

4. Click on **Create Udon Product**.
5. Enter a display name.
6. Add a description and image for your Udon product. This is optional, but we recommend doing so.

[IMAGE: How to create Udon products on VRChat.com..]

7. Click **Create**. 

## Editing Udon products

[IMAGE: How to create Udon products on VRChat.com..]

1. Click "Edit" next to any Udon product.
2. Change the name, description, or upload an image.
3. Click **Save Changes**.

You can change the product's name, description, image, and the 'Owner Names in Udon' setting. Any changes you make will apply to all your VRChat worlds without needing to reupload them. 

[IMAGE: How to create Udon products on VRChat.com..]

If you'd like to use the VRChat SDK's [Store.ListProductOwners](/economy/sdk/udon-documentation#storelistproductowners) to list the owners of a Udon product in your world, 'Owner Names in Udon' must be enabled.


## Udon products and the VRChat SDK

Adding an Udon product to your store is just the first step. You need to actually create something for people to buy, and then attach it to an Udon product in your store.

- Use VRChat's [example prefabs](/economy/sdk/examples/) to get started with Udon products.
- Use the [Creator Economy SDK](/economy/sdk/) if you're experienced with Udon. You can write your own scripts to detect if a player owns a product.
